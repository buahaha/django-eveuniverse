## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd

## [0.6.0] - 2020-10-27

### Added

- Can now also get dogmas when loading types via `eveuniverse_load_types` management command
- Added option to load dogmas when updating/creating an EveType
- New function `eveuniverse.core.esitools.is_esi_online()` for querying the current status of the Eve servers
- Added info logging to load tasks
- Added info logging for `eveuniverse.tools.testdata.create_testdata()`

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Changed interface of the test tool: `eveuniverse.tools.testdata.create_testdata()`.
- Inline objects can now also be loaded async when `wait_for_children` is set to `False`
- `all_models()` is now member of `eveuniverse.models.EveUniverseBaseModel` and also returns Inline models
It requires a list of specifications instead of a dict. Also, you now need to provide the name of the model with `ModelSpec` instead of in the dict as before.
- Reduced duration for loading testdata with `eveuniverse.tools.testdata.load_testdata_from_dict()`
- Added inline models to docs
- Added core functions to docs

### Fixed

- Name field of EveDogmaEffect was too small
- Testdata creation now also supports inline models, e.g. Dogmas
